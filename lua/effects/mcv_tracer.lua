// viewmodel in first person, of the drawn world model in third person (the left gun of a dual
// on magnitude 1). The server sends the hit position, so the origin is worked out here, on the
// client, where the drawn models live. The engine dispatches this as the bullet's own tracer
// (Tracer / TracerName on the FireBullets call), so nothing is sent by hand and nothing is
// counted on the weapon: everything comes off the gun this effect is handed.
//
// Two halves. The game's particle system is started for the smoke it trails, bound in first
// person to the weapon and the viewmodel's attachment so the engine draws it along with the
// viewmodel and it leaves the muzzle where the muzzle is on screen. The glowing streak is
// drawn by Render below, because the one the system carries never appears in GMod; Init says
// what was ruled out before it was drawn by hand.

// The streak's look, taken from the game's own systems: COLOR_* is the brightest pixel of the
// texture each family draws with (vietnam_ae_tracers_01, and _02 for the green side), and each
// entry below is that family's render_sprite_trail max length and Radius Random maximum.
